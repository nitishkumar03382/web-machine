    <!-- MACHINE LEARNING DEFINITION -->
    <h3 style="margin: 0 auto;">Definition</h3>
    <p>Machine Learning is science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.</p>
    <p><em>Here is slightly more general definition:</em><br/>
        ML is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    </p>
    <p> <em>And a more engineering-oriented one: </em><br>
        A computer program is said to learn from experience <b>E </b>  with respect to some task <b>T </b> 
        and some performance measure <b>P</b>, if its performance on <b>T </b>, measured by <b>P </b>, improves
        with experience <b>E</b>.
    </p>
<!--EXAMPLES OF MACHINE LEARNING-->
    <h3 style="margin: 0 auto;">Examples:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spam Filter</li>
            <li>Youtube or Netflix video recommendation</li>
            <li>Voice Assistance like Alexa, Google Home, Cortana(Microsoft), etc</li>
            <li>Driverless car</li>
        </ul>
        <em>and many more...</em>

<!-- WHY USE MACHINE LEARNING-->
    <h3>Why Use ML?</h3>
    <p>
    Consider how would you write a program for <em> spam filter </em> or <em>Youtube video recommendation</em>
    using traditional programming technique. <br>
    You might follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>By seeing emails you will find some pattern in those spam mails like 
            words <em> Huge</em> n times or <em>Discount </em>  m times or some fancy words 
            used frequently in spam mails.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then after finding pattern you will write logic if these patterns detected it will be a spam email.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will test your program and try to make it better until it gives good enough (or Satisfactory) result.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Here in above problem if companies those were sending spam emails if they change the pattern of sending spam mail
        then you will again have to write some more logics or do correction in previous logic to make result satisfactory.
        Hence it is very hard to manage these types of problems using traditional programming methodologies. 
        Here Machine Learning comes as saviour to these types of problems.
